A project I made to calculate the crystal diffraction structure factors for a material.

The first script calculates the structure factors, using literature values for the interpolated (Xray) or constant (neutron)
form factors, given the atoms and their positions in the unit cell.

A second script which introduces a material class that can obtain the crystal structure information from a .cif file in
conventional standard format (see materialsproject.org for example), and then call the first script to calculate the
structure factors, corrected intensities and the angular positions of the diffracted peaks.
